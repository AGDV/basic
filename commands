We assume you have installed Git bash successfully on your PC.
Lets check which we verison we have, type: git --version 
Ok, now lets set default user email, use your email: git config --global user.email 'your email example @ gmail.com'
Now we can check if our email shows up type : git config --list
You may type anytime : git --help 
Lets make a directory in our windows directory, please notice the directory name appears in your current home folder, type : git mkdir test
We have now created a folder under name "test", then lets go inside the folder by type : cd test
Find the folder "test" and create a text file, name it "info" and enter information you like, then in Git bash, activate it to initialize that folder, type: git init
Lets check the status of our current folder: git status 
Now lets add the text file we've created, we use add so Git could include the file, type the following in Git bash: git add info.txt
After we have included our text file "info", Git need to be auhorized and create mode for the file: git commit -m "doing commit"
We need to use three commands (config, remote and push) in order to upload our file from PC to our Github account/page.
First lets configure Git with Github account by typing: git config --global.user.username your_username_on_github
Go to your Github account and create a repository then copy your github link, then in Git bash type: git remote add origin "paste the link here without double quotes"
You may be notified to enter your current github username and password to verify it's you, after successful verification you need to use push command.
git push origin master
That's all, you're done.
